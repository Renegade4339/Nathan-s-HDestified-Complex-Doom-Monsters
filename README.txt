(+) There are new weapons, most are from Skulltag but modified, they basically
    behave the same except from the Railgun and the 10K. The Railgun behaves like
	the Quake 2 rail and the 10K is no longer 100% accurate or hitscan.
	
>	The Assault Shotgun fires shells off at a high rate of fire, the damage is
	the same as the normal Shotgun though it is less accurate.
	
>	The Quad Shotgun can either be fired all four at once with primary fire or
    double barrel shots with altfire. Altfire also reloads after firing the first
	two barrels.
	
>	There are Hand Grenades which can be used with almost any weapon equipped,
	cannot be used with heavy type weapons such as the Rocket Launcher.
	The default key to throw them is G.
	
>	There are also Land Mines, like the Hand Grenades, they can be used with almost
	any weapon equipped. The default key to drop them is M.
	
>	The Demon Tech Rifle fires explosive projectiles (that force radius damage, so
	it will hurt the Cyber type enemies even more) at a very high rate of fire.
	This weapon uses the new Demon Ammo which can be dropped from the rarer spawns,
	gained from ammo satchels or farmed from backpacks.
	
>	The Demon Tech BFG10K is a stronger BFG, the projectile fired acts like that
	of Quake 2 where it fires off Railgun type shots at nearby enemies, when the 
	projectile explodes BFG "tracers" emit 360 degrees around the ball for incredible
	damage. This weapon also uses the new Demon ammo at 100 per shot.
	
>	The MP40 is more of an easter egg weapon, it is stronger than the Assault Rifle
	but has less accuracy.

(+) Monsters are tougher than their DooM counterparts, some damagewise, some speed,
    some both speed and damage, most even have an alternate attack all health
	remains the same though (on the common spawns). They have a slightly smaller
	pain chance.

(+) Every monster type has alternate spawns, meaning a different, more tougher monster
    has a slight chance to spawn where the original does. I have made these pretty
	tough in my opinion, not stupid op though, some may be but they are a rare
	sight and the player has more options so it evens it out. Also, these do not
	have the same health as their original spawn, I added a little more on them.

(+) New powerup spheres have a chance to spawn where the originals are, most of
    them act like their counterparts but have an extra addition like the Mega
	Spheres alt is an Ultra Sphere, it gives you 250 health and armor and also
	gives you full ammo.
	
>	Also a Red (Demonic) Armor has a chance to spawn on the Green and Blue Armor, 
	the latter having more chance to spawn it. It gives you 250 and absorbs even 
	more damage than the Blue Armor and is resistant to rocket type damage.
	
(+)	Most of the weapons are reloadable.	

(+) The player can now make use of inventory items.

(+) Tons of effects on projectiles.

(+) Scenery effects.

(+) Decoration effects.

(+) Powerup & armor effects.

(+) Bullet & shell casings.      

(+) New HUDs.

(+) Dynamic lights on pretty much everything that needs them.

(+) Player projectiles are no longer blocked by other players, prevents silly 
    accidents.

(+) Glowing flats.

There is much, much more put in but you'll have to play it to find out what 
else I did.
